# Mixed-variable-Langevin
Hybrid Ising Model Simulation with Continuous and Binary Variables Using Langevin Dynamics

Langevein Sampling involves a combination of deterministic and stochastic forces (gradient descent and brownian motion). 
This code attempts to sample from a "Bounded" mixed-variable Energy function.
